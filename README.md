# Reaction engineering folder
The folders here contain several MATLAB codes related to various reaction engineering problems.
Most of the examples are taken from Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering by Scott Fogler
## Adiabatic PFR
This is a script for a single reaction plug flow reactor operated under adiabatic conditions
## Batch reactor single reaction 
The name is actually misleading; it refers to a batch reactor with two reactions in series. The code does a concentration plot
## Batch reactor 
This is a batch reactor where two parallel reactions, viz. A+B=D and A+B=U occur. The script generates a concentration plot for species A, B, D and U
## Bio_reactor
This is a batch bio-reactor. The script tracks the concentration of substrate, cells and product. The reaction is of the Monod type
## CSTR
This script finds a way to determine the effect of different CSTR volumes on the component flow out. It uses a nested function to achieve this
## Membrane reactor 
This is a script of a membrane reactor
## PFR with series reaction 
A plug flow reactor with two reactions in series
## PFR with HE
This is a script of a non-isothermal PFR with a heat exchanger
# Thermodynamics folder
This folder contains MATLAB codes of different thermodynamic processes
