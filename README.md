# Reaction engineering folder
The folders here contain several MATLAB codes about different reaction engineering problems.
Most of the examples are taken from Elements of Chemical Reaction Engineering by Scott Fogler
## Adiabatic PFR
This is a script for a single reaction plug flow reactor operated under adiabatic conditions
## Batch reactor single reaction 
The name is actually misleading; it refers to a batch reactor with two reactions in series. The code does a concentration plot
## Batch reactor 
This is a batch reactor where two parallel reactions, viz. A+B=D and A+B=U occur. The script generates a concentration plot for species A, B, D and U
## Bio_reactor
This is a batch bio-reactor. The script tracks the concentration of substrate, cells and product. The reaction is of the Monod type
